# dam_shutter_alerting_and_opening_system
A miniproject using 741 Operational Amplifiers and 555 Timer Circuit inorder to open shutters of a dam using pressure sensing in real time and alerting people using a siren made using 555 Timer.
The equivalent voltage of the analysed pressure value can be calculated from the pressure sensor's datasheet and a difference amplifier was employed such that whenever a pressure limit is reached, the output of the difference amplifier will automatically drive a motor inorder to open the dam shutter. The activity of the motor is also used to drive a siren circuit made using 555 Timer and a speaker is attached to alert the surrounding people.
