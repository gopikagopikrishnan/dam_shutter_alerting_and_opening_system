# dam_shutter_alerting_and_opening_system
A miniproject using 741 Operational Amplifiers, 7805 fixed voltage regulator and 555 Timer Circuit inorder to open shutters of water reservoir using real time level sensing and alerting people using a siren made using 555 Timer.
The equivalent voltage of the analysed water level value can be calculated from the water level sensor's datasheet and a difference amplifier was employed such that whenever a water level limit is reached, the output of the difference amplifier will automatically drive a motor inorder to open the dam shutter. The activity of the motor is also used to drive a siren circuit made using 555 Timer and a speaker is attached to alert the surrounding people.
The siren system is powered using 7805 voltage regulator and works in the astable multivibrator mode.
